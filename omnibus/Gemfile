# `json_pure` has a bug in it that is failing Chef builds.  We include the
# json gem into the Gemfile so that running `bundle exec` will have
# this gem on the load path, and cause `require 'json/ext'` to succeed.  This
# prevents loading the `json_pure` gem

# This development group is installed by default when you run `bundle install`,

# the Test Kitchen-based build lab. You can skip these unnecessary dependencies
# by running `bundle install --without development` to speed up build times.
